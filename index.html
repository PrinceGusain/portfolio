        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Hi! I’m a BTech CSE student who enjoys solving DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems and building
            websites. I love the challenge of breaking down problems and finding efficient solutions—it’s like solving
            little puzzles every day. Web development is another passion of mine; there’s something really satisfying
            about turning an idea into a working, interactive site.

            When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me listening to music or watching travel vlogs. I enjoy
            discovering new places—virtually for now, but hopefully in person soon!

            I’m always up for learning something new, taking on interesting projects, and connecting with others who
            share a passion for tech and creativity.</h3>

            </h3>
            <h3>The Sound of Music – Movie Review</h3>
            <h4>The Sound of Music is a beautiful and heartwarming movie set in Austria just before World War II. It
                tells the story of Maria, a cheerful and kind young woman training to be a nun. She's sent to be the
                governess for a strict naval officer’s seven children. At first, the kids are distant and the father is
                cold, but Maria slowly brings music, laughter, and love into their home.

                The movie has some really famous songs like "Do-Re-Mi," "My Favorite Things," and "Edelweiss." Julie
                Andrews, who plays Maria, is absolutely charming and makes you feel every moment. The movie is also
                visually stunning, with amazing views of the mountains and countryside.

                It’s not just about music and family—it also shows how the family stands up for what’s right when the
                Nazis take over Austria. It's a mix of joy, romance, and courage that still feels meaningful even today.
            </h4>
            <h3>3 Simple Questions & Answers</h3>
            <h4>Q1: What is The Sound of Music mainly about?
                A: It’s about a woman named Maria who brings love and music into a strict family’s life and helps them
                become close again.</h4>
            <h4>Q2: How does Maria help the von Trapp family?
                A: She teaches the kids to sing and play, helps them open up emotionally, and brings the father and
                children closer together.</h4>
            <h4>Q3: Why do the von Trapps leave Austria?
                A: Because Captain von Trapp doesn’t want to work for the Nazis, so the family escapes to stay free and
                safe.</h4>
